# Install Ubuntu
This task was pretty easy for me hardly took 45 mins to dual boot win11 and ubuntu.eventhough i got some simple erors like boot menu was not enabled and 
RST(Rapid storage technology)was enabled so i googled and found solutions and i went through articles about this given in vidayaratna.
[this video](https://youtu.be/bVmTxwUuXlM) Helped me through out the installation process.
